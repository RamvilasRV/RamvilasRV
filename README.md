```python

    Initialize Ramvilas with caffeine power and a sprinkle of humor.

    Parameters:
        coffee (int): Number of coffee cups consumed (more cups, more bugs fixed).
        debug_mode (bool): If True, prints random dev jokes during execution.

    Returns:
        Developer: A quirky Python enthusiast ready to code and conquer bugs.
