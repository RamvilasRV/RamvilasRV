👋 Welcome to Ramvilas's Code Corner ☕
Hey there! I'm Ramvilas, a Python wrangler who runs on coffee and dreams of building apps that don’t crash (too often). My motto? If it’s not broken, I haven’t touched it yet.
🐍 About Me
def Ramvilas(coffee, debug_mode=False):
    """
    Initialize Ramvilas with caffeine power and a sprinkle of humor.
    Parameters:
        coffee (int): Number of coffee cups consumed (more cups, more bugs fixed).
        debug_mode (bool): If True, prints random dev jokes during execution.
    Returns:
        Developer: A quirky Python enthusiast ready to code and conquer bugs.
    """
    focus = "Python Development"
    passion = "Crafting products people love (and occasionally rage-quit)"
    bug_squashing_level = coffee * 10  # Each coffee boosts bug-zapping power
    side_quests = ["Automating boring stuff", "Googling regex for the 100th time", "Arguing tabs vs spaces"]

    if debug_mode:
        print("Why did the Python dev quit? Too many *circular imports* in life!")
    
    while True:
        try:
            code = write_awesome_code(focus, passion)
            if bug_squashing_level > 50:
                print("Warning: Excessive coffee detected. May refactor entire codebase at 2 AM.")
            return code
        except SyntaxError:
            print("Oops, forgot a colon again. Time for more coffee!")
            coffee += 1
            bug_squashing_level = coffee * 10
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print("Ctrl+C life. Ramvilas is off to debug the coffee machine!")
            break

    return "Ramvilas: Powered by Python, coffee, and a questionable sense of humor."

💻 My Tech Stack

🐍 Python: My go-to for scripting, automating, and accidentally writing poetry in code.
🌐 Django: Building web apps that are secure, scalable, and slightly over-engineered.
⚙️ DRF: Crafting APIs so smooth, even my coffee machine wants to POST a request.


🚀 Projects

Project TBDA Python/Django app that does something awesome. (Ramvilas, drop your project details here!)🔗 Link to repo | ⭐ Stars: 0 (help me out, folks!)

Another TBDProbably a DRF-powered API that serves coffee recipes. Or memes. Or both.🔗 Link to repo | ⭐ Stars: 0 (yep, still waiting!)


☕ Fun Facts

Coffee Count: I’ve lost track after cup #42.
Favorite Bug: IndentationError—because even my code needs personal space.
Life Hack: Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, pray it works.
